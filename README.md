I made this website in April 2023 for Yandex Lyceum. You could create an account and post several images with a title and description. Other users could post comments under your post. So it basically was the average basic social media.

I was going for more of a Pinterest style tiling (as you can tell by the name of this project). 

Now the sad part. The glitch.com which has been kindly hosting my app for 2 years up until now is going out of service... They are going down on 8th of July 2025 and I tried to export the data from their server. Then I tried to commit the changes in git repo but git fought me and after following some poor instructions I was eventually able to commit the changes but it cost me the whole commit history (2 commits omg) and now I have no idea if that project is working because I couldn't launch it myself (some issue which, I believe, is caused by time that has passed). I have some screenshots here, but thats it. If you manage to somehow fix it... Good for you, idk, im tired, boss

Btw, it was on palm-charming-supermarket.glitch.me
